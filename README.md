Campaign finance in the Buckeye state

FOR NOW THIS IS A TODO FILE 

This is the initial commit. It's a bit of a mess but it works. THe directories referenced in the code are static and on
my machine. I will change all paths to variables garnered from a config file. 

The unzip process fails on at least one file. I will add an exception that will not kill the process of extracting.

Right now the json transformation only works for one sample file. I'll change  this to loop over all the files and use
the Year/Quarter protocol.

MORE TO COME
